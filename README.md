# WireGuard + WGDashboard Auto Installer for Debian 12

This repository provides a fully automated Bash script to install and configure **WireGuard** and **WGDashboard** on a Debian 12 server.

## 🚀 Features

- Installs WireGuard VPN server
- Generates server keys and creates `wg0.conf`
- Configures NAT and IP forwarding
- Installs and configures [WGDashboard](https://github.com/donaldzou/WGDashboard)
- Starts both services and enables them on boot
- Outputs the web dashboard address and login credentials

## 🖥️ Requirements

- A fresh **Debian 12** system
- Root access
- An internet connection
- Ports `51820/UDP` and `10086/TCP` open on your firewall/router
- If you plan to use a domain (e.g., vpn.example.com), make sure to create an A record pointing to YOUR_SERVER_IP with Cloudflare Proxy DISABLED (grey cloud).

## 📦 What It Installs

- `wireguard`
- `python3`, `pip`, `git`
- `iptables-persistent`
- WGDashboard via Git

## ⚙️ How to Use

Download the script:

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmoreno90/WireGuard-and-WGDasboard-Installer/main/install-wireguard-wgdashboard.sh


Make it executable:

    chmod +x install-wireguard-wgdashboard.sh


Run the script:

    sudo ./install-wireguard-wgdashboard.sh


After installation, access the dashboard in your browser:

    http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:10086

## 🔐 Notes

By default, the WireGuard server uses 10.99.99.1/24.

You can change the ListenPort, credentials, or dashboard port in the config.json file (/opt/WGDashboard/config.json).

The dashboard runs as a systemd service named wgdashboard.
